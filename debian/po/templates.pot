"Magicfilter is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter. It uses "
"its own magic database (a la file(1)) to decide how to print out a given "
"print job.  Debconf can run the custom pnm2ppa script called \"update-"
"magicfilter\" to generate a default set of filters for color and black-and-"
"white printing."

"The template filter is found in /usr/share/pnm2ppa/ as \"pnm2ppa-magicfilter."

"and place the resulting filters in /etc/magicfilter.  Additionally, symbolic "
"links are created from the generated pnm2ppa filters to pbm2ppa filters (the "
"deprecated predecessor to pnm2ppa)."
