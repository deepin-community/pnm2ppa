_Description: What model of HP Deskjet printer do you use?
 The pnm2ppa printer filter behaves differently depending upon which HP
 DeskJet model you use. Choose your model of printer for the default
 configuration file /etc/pnm2ppa.conf.

Template: pnm2ppa/create_magicfilter
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Would you like debconf to create magicfilter filters?
 Magicfilter is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter. It
 uses its own magic database (a la file(1)) to decide how to print out a
 given print job.  Debconf can run the custom pnm2ppa script called
 "update-magicfilter" to generate a default set of filters for color and
 black-and-white printing.
 .
 The template filter is found in /usr/share/pnm2ppa/ as
 "pnm2ppa-magicfilter.in".  update-magicfilter uses sed to replace
 @OPTIONS@ from the template and place the resulting filters in
 /etc/magicfilter.  Additionally, symbolic links are created from the
 generated pnm2ppa filters to pbm2ppa filters (the deprecated
 predecessor to pnm2ppa).
 .
 The only thing left for you to do is run magicfilterconfig to
 generate your /etc/printcap.
