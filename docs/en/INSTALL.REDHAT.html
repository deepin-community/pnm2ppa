<P><B> Overview of HP's PPA DeskJet Printers.</B></P>
<P>Most of Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet(tm) printers use the PCL3 command language,
and are currently supported by Ghostscript drivers.  However, a few legacy 
models,
namely 
<UL>
<LI> <EM>DeskJet 710C Series</EM>: HP DeskJet 710C, 712C
<EM>(discontinued)</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>DeskJet 720C Series</EM>: HP DeskJet 720C, 722C
<EM>(discontinued)</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>DeskJet 820C Series</EM>: HP DeskJet 820Cxi, 820Cse
<EM>(discontinued)</EM></LI>
<LI> <EM>DeskJet 1000C Series</EM>: HP DeskJet 1000Cxi, 1000Cse
<EM>(discontinued)</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>feature &quot;Host-based&quot; printing, 
and use HP's proprietary
PPA (<EM>Printer Performance Architecture</EM>) protocol,
instead of PCL.   The two models in each series are physically
identical;
they just came with different bundled Windows software.
All PPA printers are now discontinued from HP's product lines,
but may still be found as second-hand legacy items.</P>
<P>PPA printers rely on software running on the
host CPU to carry out the low-level processing
of printer output that would be done by hardware in 
a standard PCL printer.  The relation of PPA printers to PCL printers
is analogous to the relation between &quot;Winmodems&quot; and true modems. 
Presumably, the idea at the time was that this would allow cheaper hardware 
to be used, but the decline in hardware prices probably meant that
the savings were not significant, and PPA printing seems to have been
abandoned.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, HP only supplied Windows software drivers for PPA printers,
and have indicated that it is unlikely that
they will ever make the proprietary PPA specs public.
This is apparently because of concerns that
publication of the specs might reveal crucial details
of HP's trade secrets about &quot;color science&quot; to competitors.  
(A secondary issue
is that it is apparently possible to physically
damage the printer by sending it
bad sequences of PPA commands, which is not the case for PCL commands,
and it seems that HP do not wish to take any responsibility for such damage by
encouraging unofficial PPA programming.)</P>
<P>In the past, Linux users often inadvertently purchased PPA DeskJet models,
mistaking them for PCL3 DeskJets, which have traditionally
been well-supported
by Linux drivers.
Fortunately, a reverse engineering effort,
started in 1998 by Tim Norman, 
and continued by the <EM>pnm2ppa</EM> project at
<A HREF="http://pnm2ppa.sourceforge.net">http://pnm2ppa.sourceforge.net</A>,
and
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa</A>
has managed to produce drivers that provide basic printing
functionality for these PPA printers under Linux and other
Unices.  While HP have recently begun to release their own Linux
drivers for PCL3 DeskJets, they have not included drivers for their legacy
PPA printers in this effort.</P>
<P>The <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> driver has been stable  since v1.04, released
October 2000, with no known reproducible bugs, except that image printing
quality was not so good.  This version has been distributed with
Red Hat, and other Linux distributions.   v1.10, released July 2002,
contains a lot of changes that improve image quality, in particular
by improved bidirectional printing, and 
always printing black on top of color.</P>
<P>A better improvement would be for someone to make a PPA backend to 
<A HREF="http://gimp-print.sourceforge.net">gimp-print</A>, using
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> as a guide for how to send data to PPA printers.
But, since PPA printers are now &quot;legacy&quot; hardware, and 
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> appears to
work fine for most printing tasks, it is unlikely that any new developers will
be interested in doing this, and there is currently no further development
anticipated.   The project is currently in &quot;low-maintenance mode&quot;.</P>

<P><B> The pnm2ppa driver for color printing with  PPA printers.</B></P>
<P>Color printing with PPA printers is supported by the 
<EM><CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE></EM> driver which is the successor to the  older
black-and-white-only driver 
<A HREF="http://pnm2ppa.sourceforge.net/files/pbm2ppa-0.8.6.tar.gz">pbm2ppa-0.8.6</A> developed by Tim Norman.  </P>
<P><CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> 
translates <EM>portable anymap</EM> (<EM>pnm</EM>)
format images into a stream of PPA instructions which can be sent to the
printer.   In the driver name, 
&quot;<EM>pnm</EM>&quot; stands for the superset 
of <EM>three</EM> image formats:
<EM>ppm</EM> (portable &quot;pixmap&quot; format for color images),
<EM>pgm</EM> (portable &quot;greymap&quot; format for greyscale images),
and <EM>pbm</EM> (portable &quot;bitmap&quot; format for black and white  images).</P>
<P>Ghostscript has a number of &quot;output devices&quot; that
produce pnm format output from postscript or pdf input.
These come in <EM>plain</EM> (text) and <EM>raw</EM> 
(binary) variants.  While <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> can now interpret
both plain and raw pnm formats, there is no point in using the
inefficient plain formats: <EM>always</EM> use the &quot;raw&quot;
output devices, which are:
<UL>
<LI><EM>ppmraw</EM> - raw pixmap format (color images);</LI>
<LI><EM>pgmraw</EM> - raw greymap format (greyscale images);</LI>
<LI><EM> pbmraw</EM> - raw bitmap format (black and white images);</LI>
<LI><EM>pnmraw</EM> - selects between ppm, pgm, and pbm raw formats;</LI>
<LI><EM>pgnmraw</EM> - selects between pgm and pbm raw formats.</LI>
</UL>

The last two output devices are switches that try to analyze the
image, and  select an appropriate format; however, they are not
recommended for routine use, as they may inconsistently choose the format.
The <CODE>ghostscript</CODE>
packages supplied with all recent Red Hat distributions provides all these
devices.  To see the list of available
ghostscript output devices, type the command line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gs --help
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

if the required <CODE>ppmraw</CODE> or
<CODE>pbmraw</CODE> devices are not shown, you will have to upgrade your
version of ghostscript.</P>
<P>The data must be streamed directly from ghostscript to
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> to the (local) printer without being
stored in any intermediate
file: one ppm-format (color) US Letter size page is represented
by 3x5100x6600 Bytes (100MB) in binary format and four times this amount in
text format. </P>

<P>An example of 
a command line for printing a postscript
file <CODE>file.ps</CODE> using <CODE>gs</CODE> (ghostscript) and <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
cat file.ps | gs -q -sDEVICE=ppmraw -r600 -sPAPERSIZE=letter -dNOPAUSE \
 -sOutputFile=- - | pnm2ppa --eco -v 720  -i - -o - | lpr -l  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(all on a single line).   In this example the paper size is explicitly
given to  <CODE>gs</CODE> as <EM>US Letter</EM>
(8.5&quot;x11&quot;) size
(<CODE>letter</CODE>); <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> no longer needs to be told what
the paper size is,  and will read it from the  <CODE>gs</CODE> output (and check
that it is a permitted size for the printer type).   
The  <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> option <CODE>--eco</CODE> specifies &quot;EconoFast&quot;
mode, for a lower quality output which uses less ink, and prints faster,
and <CODE>-v 720</CODE> specifies the PPA printer as belonging
to the DeskJet 720C series.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> expects that the input resolution is 600dpi
(or 300dpi if it is called with the <CODE>pnm2ppa --dpi300 ...</CODE>option).
This corresponds to the <CODE>gs -r600 ...</CODE> or
<CODE>gs -r300 ... </CODE> ghostscript options.
If other higher/lower input resolutions are used, the size of
the printed image will be larger/smaller, provided it is 
within the printer's allowed size range.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Obviously, it would be impractical to type such a command each time
one wished to print something, and since RedHat 6.2, printfilter
support for <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> is built into Red Hat's printer 
configuration scheme, so after configuration,
the simple command
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
lpr file.ps
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

should successfully print a postscript file.
However, in case you wish to check if something
is misconfigured in the print filters, you can use a script like the
above one to bypass them and check that the printer is working.
<UL>
<LI><EM>Also, if you wish to print to paper sizes supported by ghostscript,
but not supported by the Red Hat Printer configuration utilities, you can
use  scripts like the one above.
The HP 710C, 720C, and 820C series support paper sizes  from
3&quot;x3&quot; to 8.5&quot;x14&quot;, while the 1000C
supports 4&quot;x6&quot; to 13&quot;x19&quot;.</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P><B> Available RPM packages.</B>
A RPM package for <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> is  part of the Red Hat Linux 
distribution starting with Red Hat 6.2.  
You will also find a RPM package for the latest release of 
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> 
at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa</A>.   </P>
<P>The latest version at the time
of writing is 
<CODE>pnm2ppa-1.10-1rh7x.i386.rpm</CODE>, and is built on
Red Hat 7.3, or
<CODE>pnm2ppa-1.10-1rh62.i386.rpm</CODE>, built on
Red Hat 6.2.
If you are running a different  release 
of Red Hat (or a  different Linux  distribution)
you may need to download and rebuild the source RPM
<CODE>pnm2ppa-1.10-1.src.rpm</CODE> instead:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rpm --rebuild pnm2ppa-1.10-1.src.rpm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(You must be <CODE>root</CODE> to do this, and have the necessary
compilers installed; on Red Hat, the rebuilt binary RPM will be created in
the directory  <CODE>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/</CODE>.)</P>
<P>Red Hat 6.2 and later also includes support for configuring your
printer to use <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>.
(Information necessary for configuring 
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> on older Red Hat releases has been removed from
this document; for this, see the documentation that came with 
<CODE>pnm2ppa-1.04</CODE>, or update your RedHat distribution.)
Note: If you are still using Red Hat 6.2, you may wish to update the
print filter support for <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> that comes with it.   
The <CODE>pnm2ppa-1.10-1rh62*</CODE>
RPM package supplies the necessary files that you can use.
After installing this RPM, see
<CODE>/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/README.ppa</CODE> for details.</P>

<P><B> Installing the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> RPM package and setting up the PPA printer.</B></P>
<P>To install the RPM package, you must log in as the system administrator,
<CODE>root</CODE>.   </P>
<P>Now begin the installation. First install the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> RPM:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
rpm -Uvh pnm2ppa-1.10-1*.i386.rpm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> executable gets installed in <CODE>/usr/bin/</CODE>.</P>
<P>The  Linux  kernel will be able to autodetect
IEEE-1284 devices like PPA printers, provided they are attached
to the parallel port with a bidirectional IEEE-1284 cable.  (If your
printer works under Windows, you have the correct cable.)
A script <CODE>detect_ppa</CODE> is provided by the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
RPM:  just type
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
detect_ppa
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
to confirm that your Printer is found.
A typical message from the printer, which will
be displayed if autodetection is successful, is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
CLASS:PRINTER;
MODEL:DESKJET 820C;
MANUFACTURER:HEWLETT-PACKARD;
DESCRIPTION:Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 820C;
COMMAND SET:SCP,VLINK;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

A list of PPA printers found, and the parallel ports to which they are
attached, will also be shown.</P>

<P>At this point it is useful to test that your printer is working, by
printing a test page using the supplied script <CODE>test_ppa</CODE>
which the RPM has installed.    You will need to know your
printer model (710, 712, 720, 722, 820, 1000), your paper size
(letter, legal, a4) and the printer port the printer is attached to.
If it is attached to the primary parallel port, this is 
(usually) <EM><CODE>/dev/lp0</CODE></EM>.
Type
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
test_ppa
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

and give the details about printer model. papersize, and port number
when prompted.   
You will  then be asked 
whether to print a test page, an offset calibration
page, or an alignment calibration page, etc.
<UL>
<LI> <EM><EM>Tip:</EM>
The </EM><CODE>test_ppa</CODE><EM> script 
does not use the Red Hat print filters, so it is
useful when troubleshooting, for testing if any printing problems are
associated with the basic printer installation, or with the
configuration of the print filters.</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P><B> Configuring the print filters.</B></P>
<P>Note:  Red Hat 7.3 now features either CUPS or LPRng printer management.
The configuration tools should be able to configure <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>,
using the information about it taken from the Linux Printer Database.
Apart from the addition of a new <CODE>--dpi300</CODE> option
to accept 300dpi input (useful for printing PNM output from 300dpi scanners),
there have been no changes in the pnm2ppa command line since the pnm2ppa-1.0
release, so the configuration scripts are stable.  (They 
can only use the default 600dpi input mode.)</P>
<P>Since Red Hat 7.1, there is a graphical
printer configuration utility <CODE>printconf-gui</CODE>.  In Red Hat 6.2 and
7.0, the older configuration utility called <CODE>printtool</CODE> is used.
In either case,
start the &quot;<EM>Red Hat Linux Print System Manager</EM>&quot; 
(as root) to 
configure the printer, either
by clicking on the printer icon in Red Hat's &quot;control-panel&quot;,
or just typing 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
printtool
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

which also starts <CODE>printconf-gui</CODE> in the newer Red Hat releases.</P>

<P><B> Configuring the print filters with the Red Hat 6.2/7.0 printtool</B></P>
<P>(Skip this section unless you are still using Red Hat 6.2 or 7.0)</P>
<P>The following description is for the older <CODE>printtool</CODE> that
is used by Red Hat 6.2/7.0.   The printer configuration utility 
<CODE>printconf-gui</CODE> for Red Hat 7.1 and later
is a little different, as it is based on the <EM>foomatic</EM> printer
configuration database which contains entries for <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
(but not the older <CODE>pbm2ppa</CODE>).  You should be able to easily figure out
what to do: it can configure all <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> command-line options in the
<EM>Driver Options</EM> screen.</P>
<P>In the Red Hat 6.2/7.0 Print System Manager window, click on <EM>Add</EM>, then
in the &quot;Add a Printer Entry&quot;, select <EM>Local Printer</EM>, and
click <EM>Ok</EM>. Hopefully, the port on which the printer is attached
will be listed as &quot;Detected&quot; (<EM>if not, 
fix the problem before continuing</EM>, perhaps by
adding the line &quot;<CODE>alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc</CODE>&quot;
to <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE>).
You will now have to &quot;<EM>edit
the local printer entry</EM>&quot; for the PPA printer.    Click on
<EM>Select</EM> to chose the &quot;Input filter&quot;.  
The <EM>Configure Filter</EM> screen will open.
Among the many printer entries in the list
&quot;<EM>Printer Type</EM>&quot;, you should find three entries
<UL>
<LI><B>HP DeskJet 1000 series (PPA)</B> (for 1000Cse, 1000Cxi models)</LI>
<LI><B>HP DeskJet 710/720 series (PPA)</B> (for 710C, 712C, 720C, 722C models)</LI>
<LI><B>HP DeskJet 820 series (PPA)</B> (for 820Cse, 820Cxi models)</LI>
</UL>

Select the appropriate
entry for your printer model. You will then be presented with
various options:
<UL>
<LI>The <EM>Driver Description</EM> box contains information about the
driver (you may have to use the scrollbar at the right of the box
to read it all).   </LI>
<LI>The <EM>resolution</EM> box shows a single
resolution (600x600).  There are no other choices.</LI>
<LI>The <EM>Paper Size</EM> box allows 
various choices (only <EM>letter</EM>, <EM>legal</EM>, and <EM>a4</EM>
seem correspond to native paper sizes printed by the Red Hat print filters;
the other choices, (a3, ledger, ...) appear to get resized by
the print filters to print on US Letter size paper (?) ).
(Other paper sizes cannot be selected this way, but you <EM>can</EM>
print to any papersize, <EM>if it supported by both ghostscript 
and the printer</EM>, using a script, as described above, that bypasses
the  RedHat printfilters.)</LI>
<LI>The <EM>Color Depth/ Uniprint Mode</EM> box allows various selections
of color and print quality (These are achieved by
using  various combinations
of the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> options
<EM>--eco</EM> (EconoFast mode), <EM>-p</EM> (disable black
ink cartridge) and <EM>--bw</EM> (black and white printing only),
without direct intervention by the user.)  The choices (in the
most recent <CODE>printerdb</CODE> database) are:
<UL>
<LI> Black and White, econofast mode (<CODE>--bw --eco</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Black and White, normal quality (<CODE>--bw</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Color, econofast  mode (<CODE>--eco --fd</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Color, normal quality (<CODE>--eco</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Color, high quality </LI>
<LI> Color, normal quality, black ink disabled (<CODE>-p --eco</CODE>)</LI>
<LI> Color, high quality, black ink disabled (<CODE>-p --uni</CODE>)</LI>
</UL>

(These are the choices that will be  presented by &quot;official&quot;
<CODE>rhs-printfilters-1.72</CODE>; if you installed a <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
RPM package from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">the SourceForge pnm2ppa site</A>, you may have a file
<CODE>/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/README.ppa</CODE> explaining how to modify
earlier versions of <CODE>rhs-printfilters</CODE> to show these updated
choices.)  

You may also see a choice to use the older &quot;Legacy&quot;
driver <CODE>pbm2ppa</CODE> (black and white only); this is 
is stable but unmaintained; it may still be a useful
alternative to  <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> on older, slower systems with
less available memory. 
</LI>
<LI>The three <EM>Printing options</EM> are not relevant here, and
should <EM>not</EM> be selected. They are for direct printing
of text (ascii) to non-postscript printers, but since the only way of printing
text files with <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> is
by first converting them to postscript(tm), this is <EM>not</EM> 
possible on the PPA printer.
<UL>
<LI><EM>It is important that the choice </EM>
&quot;Fast text printing (non-PS printers only)&quot;<EM> is NOT selected, 
so that the print filters will
convert text files to postscript before printing.</EM>  </LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>The <EM>Margins</EM>
entries control the margins used when printing text files
(these are instructions to the text-to-postscript
conversion process).</LI>
<LI>The <EM>Extra GS options</EM> box is not only a place for adding
options for ghostscript, but also for the PPA drivers.  
<EM>Leave this box empty unless you know what you are doing</EM>.
As explained in the text in the Driver Description box
(you did read it, didn't you ?),  the entry should be  in the format:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
 
gs_options PPA ppa_options 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Anything before the 
&quot;<CODE>PPA</CODE>&quot; is interpreted as a <CODE>gs</CODE> option, anything after it
is interpreted as a <CODE>ppa</CODE> option.  You can learn about 
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> options by typing either &quot;<CODE>man pnm2ppa</CODE>&quot;
or &quot;<CODE>pnm2ppa --help</CODE>&quot; at a command line (hopefully, these
two sources of information will be consistent with each other!);</LI>
</UL>

When you have made your choices, click on <EM>Ok</EM> to 
save your selections and close the &quot;Configure Filter&quot; screen,
and then click  on <EM>OK</EM> to close the &quot;Edit Local Printer Entry&quot;
screen.</P>
<P>You are now back in the &quot;Red Hat Print System Manager&quot; screen;
highlight the printer you just configured, and, in the <EM>Tests</EM>
menu, choose <EM>Print Postscript test page</EM> to print a test page using
the Red Hat print filters.  If this printed correctly, your
print system is set up to use the PPA printer, just like any of the other
printers that the Red Hat print filters support.</P>



<P><B> Configuring pnm2ppa.conf and calibrating the printer. </B></P>
<P>A number of printer parameters are set to reasonable  default values
for each  of the printer models, but you may wish to &quot;fine tune&quot;
or calibrate your printer.   The  default values can be overridden
by entries in the configuration files, which by default are
<CODE>/etc/pnm2ppa.conf</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/pbm2ppa.conf</CODE>.
At  600dpi, one pixel is 1/600 inch. </P>
<P>The user-adjustable parameters are:
<UL>
<LI> <B>verbose 1</B> and <B>silent 1</B>.   These control
messages about progress and errors from  <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>.  By default,
messages are sent to the system log <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>.
The <CODE>verbose 1</CODE> keyword send copies to  <CODE>stderr</CODE>, the
standard error stream to the terminal.   The <CODE>silent 1</CODE>
keyword silences the stream of messages to the system log.
<UL>
<LI><B> The system log messages  may be  silenced in the default
configuration file; switch off &quot;silent&quot;
mode  with &quot;silent 0&quot; for debugging printer
problems (or use verbose mode).</B></LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI> The <B>version</B> keyword can be used to specify
the printer model as  710, 712, 720, 722, 820, or 1000.
It is not needed if you use the RedHat printool to
configure the printer.
</LI>
<LI> <B>xoffset</B> and <B>yoffset</B>: the x-offset and y-offset
(in pixels) of the
printed image on the page, which should be chosen so the image
is correctly centered on the paper.  (These can also be set with
the <CODE> -x  &lt;xoff&gt; </CODE> and <CODE> -y &lt;yoff&gt; </CODE> options.)
See 
<A HREF="./CALIBRATION.html">CALIBRATION.html</A> (or CALIBRATION.txt) for more information.

</LI>
<LI> <B>topmargin</B>, <B>bottommargin</B>, <B>leftmargin</B>, 
<B>rightmargin</B>: the four
margins, which define the distances (in pixels)
from the edges of the paper to the
printed region; parts of the image that are outside these margins
will not be printed.
(These can also be set with the
<CODE> -t &lt;top margin&gt; </CODE>,
<CODE> -b &lt;bottom margin&gt; </CODE>,
<CODE> -l &lt;left margin&gt; </CODE>, and
<CODE> -r &lt;right margin&gt; </CODE>
options.) 
</LI>
<LI> <B>ColOffsX</B> and <B>ColOffsY</B>: the  x-offset and y-offset
(in pixels)
between  the color image produced by the color ink printer head, and that
produced by the black ink printer head.
These should be recalibrated 
<B> each time an ink cartridge is replaced</B>.  
See 
<A HREF="./CALIBRATION.html">CALIBRATION.html</A> (or CALIBRATION.txt) for more information.
</LI>
<LI> <B>blackshear</B> and <B>colorshear</B>: these are x offsets
between right-to-left and left-to-right sweeps of the print head, one for 
the black printing and one for the color printing.  These provide sideways
offsets  (in pixels)  of the right-to-left sweeps, 
that can be used to correct &quot;shearing&quot; when printing
in modes that use bidirectional print head sweeps.
</LI>
<LI><B>unimode 1</B>  will make unidirectional
print sweeps (left-to-right) the default, instead
of bidirectional sweeps. The <CODE>--uni</CODE>
and <CODE>--bi</CODE> options can control how a particular print
run is printed.    Unidirectional printing is only useful
(it is slower) if there are issues  of &quot;shearing&quot;
in high quality image printing.
</LI>
<LI> <B>blackness</B> : this takes values 0,1,2,3 or 4 drops of
black ink per pixel, and controls black ink density in black-and-white
and &quot;text-like&quot;  black regions  in color printing.   At present,
this has no effect on printing  with the black ink cartridge  disabled,
or on black regions identified as &quot;image-like&quot;.   (This can
also be set with the <CODE> -B &lt;n&gt;</CODE> option,
where <CODE>n</CODE> is the number of drops.)

</LI>
<LI><B>GammaR</B>, <B>GammaG</B>, and <B>GammaB</B>:
the are the three &quot;gamma&quot; parameters that define the 
standard  color correction
curves for red, green, and blue.   Changing these will affect how
colors appear (decreasing any Gamma enhaces the corresponding color).   
The Gamma values are specified as decimal numbers,
with Gamma = 1.0 corresponding to no color correction.</LI>
<LI>Gamma values can also be specified using integer numbers
<B>RedGammaIdx</B>, <B>GreenGammaIdx</B>, <B>BlueGammaIdx</B>;
These are determined by a procedure  discussed in 
<A HREF="./COLOR.html">COLOR.html</A> or COLOR.txt,
which involves printing a test page.  The <B>papersize</B>
keyword specifies the paper size used  for this testpage,
because it is produced by <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> without the input that
usually specifies the page size.</LI>
<LI>The keywords 
<B>black_ink 0</B>, 
<B>color_ink 0</B>, 
<B>cyan_ink 0</B>, 
<B>magenta_ink 0</B>, 
and <B>yellow_ink 0</B>
can be used to switch of the various inks; this can be useful
in troubleshooting and debugging  <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Use <CODE>test_ppa</CODE> to print various test pages
or calibration patterns to adjust the offsets. </P>
<P>If you wish to specify these
parameters using the command-line options 
described above, in Red Hat 6.2/7.0 some of them can be 
entered in the &quot;extra GS options&quot; box using the Print System Manager
(<CODE>printtool</CODE>), as described above. 
In Red Hat 7.1 and later, all command-line options can be set using the new
<CODE>printconf-gui</CODE> utility.</P>

<P><B> Utility programs for the printer.</B></P>
<P>HP's  Windows software provides a utility program
that sends PPA commands to tell the printer to perform
tasks like cleaning the printheads, etc.   </P>
<P>On Red Hat Linux, You can use <CODE>test_ppa</CODE> 
(which acts as a command-line front-end for
<CODE>calibrate_ppa</CODE>) to print head-cleaning patterns.</P>
<P>There is  a graphical (gtk-based) tool 
written by Javier Sedano
for creating
a <CODE>pnm2ppa.conf</CODE> file and acting as a front end to
<CODE>calibrate_ppa</CODE>.
This is called <CODE>ppaSet</CODE>, and a beta version of it can be found
in the same place as the <CODE>pnm2ppa-1.10</CODE> distribution  
at 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa</A></P>
<P>There was also at one time a proposal to add support for PPA printers to the
PUP (Printer Utility Program) utility, which is
also a project at
<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1118">http://www.sourceforge.net</A>.   
However, as of the time of writing, no PUP support
for PPA printers is available.</P>

<P><B>Troubleshooting</B></P>
<P>The first thing to do is to look at the messages from <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
in the system log to see what is happening, whether <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
<B>actually received any input</B>, and if it was valid.
<B> (You may  need to enable system log messages in 
<CODE>/etc/pnm2ppa.conf</CODE>, see above.)</B>
Maybe  ghostscript failed to convert your postscript file into
PNM format: in that case the system log reports 
<B>&quot;Fatal Error! Input image (pnm2ppa) is not a PNM image&quot;</B>.
(note: when this occured, older versions of <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> reported 
<B>&quot;Input image is not a supported PNM format&quot;</B> which
may have been confusing).
This is because the input received by <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> was not a valid
PNM image, but instead ghostscript failed to produce any
PNM output at all, and its only output was probably just an error message.   
This is <EM>not</EM> a <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> problem!</P>
<P>Here are suggestions for dealing with other problems that you may encounter.
<UL>
<LI><B> Printing fails in the middle of a print run</B>, perhaps
when a figure embedded in the document is printing (in the latest
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> versions, printing finishes normally, but an incomplete
document is printed).   The system  log
reports that <CODE>read_line</CODE> could not read the image, and found EOF
(end-of-file).    This probably
means that <CODE>ghostscript</CODE>'s &quot;ppmraw&quot; or 
&quot;pgmraw&quot; output device started correctly, but
failed for some reason before finishing the image conversion 
from postscript to PNM format, usually leaving a core dump.
(This has been seen to happen in ghostscript 5.10 ;
upgrading to ghostscript 5.50 solved the problem.)  If you cannot
upgrade, try printing the document
in black-and-white using the ghostscript &quot;pbmraw&quot; output device.</LI>
<LI><B>You printed  an image file using a  &quot;high quality&quot; 
printer setting, but it has  visible horizontal  lines 
on it </B>and printing under Windows(tm) 9x doesn't
show  this effect (except in &quot;economode&quot;).
These are probably &quot;swath boundaries&quot;,
showing the junction between different sweeps of the print head.
Solution: using unidirectional printing (PPA option <CODE>--uni</CODE>,
or <CODE>unimode 1</CODE> in <CODE>/etc/pnm2ppa.conf</CODE>) helps a little.
<B>this problem is fixed in the pnm2ppa-1.10 release</B></LI>
<LI>&quot;<B>Flashing light syndrome</B> &quot;.
Your printer usually works, but you have found that some particular
documents cause the printer to fail, and the lights on its panel
start flashing rapidly in sequence.   Solution, turn the printer off and back
on again.   This is not supposed to happen any more; if it happens 
reproducibly, contact the pnm2ppa developers, and offer to 
make the offending
file available for testing and diagnosis of this problem.
(Don't sent it to the Mailing List unless requested).
Bug reports can be filed at
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">the SourceForge pnm2ppa site</A>.</LI>
<LI><B>You wish to  print on envelopes or other non-standard media
not supported by the  print filters</B>?
Solution:  if you can get  Ghostscript (<CODE>gs</CODE>) to
produce the correct image, and the paper size is in the range allowed
by  your printer, you should be able to do this with a
script that bypasses the print filters, as described earlier
in this document.</LI>
<LI><B>Colors look wrong, or do not match what the Windows(tm) 9x driver
produces</B>.  Solution:  check that
your color ink cartridge is
not running out of some ink color; if not,
(a) adjust the &quot;gamma&quot;
entries in <CODE>/etc/pnm2ppa,conf</CODE>, or (b)
install a customized color calibration file
<CODE>/etc/pnm2ppa.gamma</CODE>.  See the file
<A HREF="./COLOR.html">COLOR.html</A> (or COLOR.txt) for more information.</LI>
