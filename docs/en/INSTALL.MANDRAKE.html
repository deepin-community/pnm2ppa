<H1>PPA Printer-Support RPM Packages for MANDRAKE Linux distributions.</H1>

<H2>The pnm2ppa project team 
<A HREF="mailto:ppa-rpms@sourceforge.net">ppa-rpms@users.sourceforge.net</A></H2>v0.2 June 11,  2002
<HR>
<EM>Information about using  pnm2ppa with Mandrake. (Updated for pnm2ppa-1.04 and later.)</EM>
<HR>
<P><B> Mandrake-specific issues.</B></P>
<P>See the document
<A HREF="file:INSTALL.REDHAT.html">INSTALL.REDHAT.html</A>
for installation and setup.  That document is written
for Red Hat; note the Mandrake-specific differences 
listed below,</P>
<P><B> To update <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE>
in any recent Mandrake release (7.2 or later) from  v1.04 to v1.10, 
the simplest procedure may  be
just to compile pnm2ppa from tarball source and replace the Mandake binaries
<CODE>/usr/bin/pnm2ppa</CODE> and <CODE>/usr/bin/calibrate_ppa</CODE> with
the new versions.   They should function as drop-in replacements,
with the same user interface, but improved image quality.
(You may also wish to use the newer <CODE>pnm2ppa.conf</CODE> configuration
file template).</B></P>




<P>
<UL>
<LI> Mandrake 7.0 and earlier has incompatible and non-functional
<CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> support which must be  replaced.
Please use 
<CODE>printtool</CODE> to delete any installed PPA printers   BEFORE
upgrading <CODE>rhs-printfilters</CODE>.  (If you forget to do this, and
printtool will not start after the update, delete or move your
<CODE>/etc/printcap</CODE> file.)
Install the <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> RPM package.
Then update <CODE>rhs-printfilters</CODE> with
<CODE>rhs-printfilters-1.58-4ppa5mdk.i386.rpm</CODE>
from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa</A>.
(Do  <B>NOT</B> use <CODE>rhs-printfilters-1.57-4ppa4.i386.rpm</CODE>
which is for RedHat systems only.)</LI>
<LI>Mandrake-7.1 supplies a <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> RPM  and has support for
it in <CODE>rhs-printfilters</CODE>.   Mandrake 7.1 has a configuration
tool <CODE>DrakConf</CODE> for setting up printers, which may
be an interface to <CODE>printtool</CODE>.
Some users have reported difficulties with this.  In that case, just use 
<CODE>printtool</CODE> to configure the printer.</LI>
<LI>Mandrake-7.2  does not have a separate <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> RPM package, but has
added  <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> to the <CODE>ghostscript</CODE> RPM package.  This creates
difficulties for updating <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> with the RPM package from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa</A>.
You will get reported conflicts with <CODE>ghostscript</CODE> 
if you try to install the
<CODE>pnm2ppa-1.04-1.i386.rpm</CODE> package, 
but it seems that you can 
safely  use the rpm  option <CODE>--force</CODE> to force its installation.
Mandrake-7.2 also has moved to using CUPS as its printing system,
and appears to now have its own printer configuration tool, but still
includes <CODE>pnm2ppa</CODE> support in <CODE>rhs-printfilters</CODE>.</LI>
